# Linked Lists
Linked lists are a non-contiguous data structure. What this means is that 
the data in memory is not stored in sequential addresses of memory.
Instead, each node contains a reference (ie, a pointer) to the next node in the sequence, allowing the nodes to be scattered throughout memory.
